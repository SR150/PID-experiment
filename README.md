# PID-experiment
This is an experiment I have done with PID control
PID control is a system used to control real world values the 2 examples here are the steering of a boat and a tank of buffer solution trying to maintain a specific pH.

It will simulate a specific period of time then graph how the value being controlled over that time changes.
